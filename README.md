# ElevensGame

I made this project during my APCSA class to demonstrate a knowledge of techniques and methods to create a card game. 

To use, download the files to an IDE, such as Replit, and then run the program using the provided files

Solitaire card game using a standard 52-card deck. 
Cards placed in a 3x3 grid, pairs of cards that add up to eleven (Ex. 5 and 6, Ace and 10) are removed; face cards (J, Q, K) may be eliminated in a set of three cards consisting of one Jack, one Queen and one King regardless of suit. 
If all cards are removed the game is won; if there are no more pairs of cards that add up to eleven, and there do not exist a Jack, a Queen, and a King, the game is lost
